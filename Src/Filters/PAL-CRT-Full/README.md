### Description
Another deep rabbit hole traversed. PAL is surprisingly more complicated to emulate in software than NTSC.  
This library aims to be a realistic (in terms of visual output) software PAL modem.  
It can be used as a standalone application, an image filter, or used in real time applications like emulators.  
Written to be compatible with C89.  

Just like King's Crook (my from-scratch 3D game), this code follows the same restrictions:

1. Everything must be done in software, no explicit usage of hardware acceleration.
2. No floating point types or literals, everything must be integer only.
3. No 3rd party libraries, only C standard library and OS libraries for window, input, etc.
4. No languages used besides C.
5. No compiler specific features and no SIMD.
6. Single threaded.

------
### Feature List:

- Relatively accurate composite PAL image output  
  -- with bandlimited luma/chroma  
  -- color artifacts  
  -- Hanover bars (with optional suppression of them)  
  -- accurate dot crawl  
  -- the 25 Hz offset of the color subcarrier in standard PAL is emulated  
  
- VSYNC and HSYNC
- Signal noise (optional)
- Interlaced and progressive scan
- Monochrome and full color
- NES decoding support

## Important

The command line program provided does not let you mess with all the settings
like black/white point, brightness, saturation, and contrast.

In the pal_main.c file, there are two main()'s.
One is for a command line program and the other uses my FW library (found here https://github.com/LMP88959/PL3D-KC)
to provide real-time PAL emulation with adjustable parameters.

## Regarding NES Mode

NES Mode is a separate version of PAL-CRT that has adjusted timings to match the non-standard NES specifications.  
https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/PAL_video  
These timings and extra NES specific features were incorporated into the NES version by Persune.

## Compiling

```sh
cd PAL-CRT

cc -O3 -o pal *.c
```

or using CMake on Linux, macOS, or Windows:

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
build/pal
```

The default command line takes a single PPM or BMP image file and outputs a processed PPM or BMP file:

```
usage: ./pal -m|o|c|p|r|h|a outwidth outheight noise field phase_error infile outfile
sample usage: ./pal -oc 640 480 24 0 2 in.ppm out.ppm
sample usage: ./pal -pcr 768 576 24 5 0 in.ppm out.ppm
sample usage: ./pal - 832 624 0 2 1 in.ppm out.ppm
-- NOTE: the - after the program name is required
	field number is only meaningful in progressive mode
	phase error is 0, 1, or 2. 0 being none, and 2 being the most
------------------------------------------------------------
	m : monochrome
	o : do not prompt when overwriting files
	c : do Hanover bar correction
	p : progressive scan (rather than interlaced)
	r : raw image (needed for images that use artifact colors)
	a : save analog signal as image instead of decoded image
	h : print help

by default, the image will be full color, interlaced, and scaled to the output dimensions
```

There is also the option of "live" rendering to a video window from an input PPM/BMP image file:

```sh
cmake -B build -Dlive=on
cmake --build build
build/pal my.ppm
```

### Adding PAL-CRT to your C/C++ project:

Global variables:
```c
#include "pal_core.h"

static struct PAL_CRT crt;
static struct PAL_SETTINGS pal;
static int color = 1;
static int noise = 12;
static unsigned field = 0;
static int raw = 0;
static int hue = 0;
```

In your initialization function:
```c
/* pass it the buffer to be drawn on screen */
pal_init(&crt, screen_width, screen_height, PAL_PIX_FORMAT_BGRA, screen_buffer);
/* specify some settings */
crt.blend = 1;
crt.scanlines = 1;
/* check out the PAL_CRT struct for more settings */

```

In your drawing loop:
```c
pal.data = video_buffer; /* buffer from your rendering */
pal.format = PAL_PIX_FORMAT_BGRA;
pal.w = video_width;
pal.h = video_height;
pal.as_color = color;
pal.field = field;
pal.raw = raw;
pal.hue = hue;
/* check out the PAL_SETTINGS struct for more settings */
pal_modulate(&crt, &pal);
pal_demodulate(&crt, noise);
field++;
```
